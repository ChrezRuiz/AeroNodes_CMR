- based on the 4 basic forces of flight during climb

### Equations:
$$R/C=Vsin(\theta)$$
if $$V=\sqrt{\frac{2W}{\rho s C_{l}}}$$
thus,
$$R/C=\sqrt{\frac{2W}{\rho s C_{l}}}[sin(\theta)]$$




$$\sum_\text{Vertical} = L-Wcos(a)+Tsin(\theta)$$


$$R/C=\frac{\text{Excess Power}}{W}$$
Power, overcoming weight, thus upward momentum = R/C
