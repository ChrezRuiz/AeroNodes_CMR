*displayed in:* [Electric Tachometer](./Electric%20Tachometer.md) (%RPM)
- due to no section having similar speeds, the % of its max speed is used for simplicity
*influenced by:* fuel flow control

### Definition:
- each compressor section or turbine has a separate [Electric Tachometer](./Electric%20Tachometer.md)
- *for [Centrifugal Flow Compressor](Centrifugal%20Flow%20Compressor.md):* 
	- thrust is directly indicated
- *for [Axial Flow Compressor](Axial%20Flow%20Compressor.md):* 
	- RPM is displayed to monitor overspeed conditions

### Basic Functions:
- Monitor engine speed
- Monitor over-speeding
- Indicate section speed and thrust
- Check operating schedules of engine support systems
- Check engine speed during in-flight shutdown and windmilling
