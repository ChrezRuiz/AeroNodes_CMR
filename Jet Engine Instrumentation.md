- *Familiarity of the location, procedures of operations, and movement of engine controls is necessary for an aviation maintenance technician*
- *Familiarity of engine instruments and ability to comprehend markings are crucial in engine operation*

- unlike reciprocating engines, jet engine instruments also produce engine performance data such as [Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR)](./Engine%20Pressure%20Ratio%20(EPR).md), [Turbine Discharge Pressure (TPR)](./Turbine%20Discharge%20Pressure%20(TPR).md), and [Torque](./Torque.md)
- comprehension of these instruments and indications enables the technician to identify the performance and airworthiness of the jet engine
