- *Familiarity of the location, procedures of operations, and movement of engine controls is necessary for an aviation maintenance technician*
- *Familiarity of engine instruments and ability to comprehend markings are crucial in engine operation*

- unlike reciprocating engines, jet engine instruments also produce engine performance data such as [Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR)](./Engine%20Pressure%20Ratio%20(EPR).md), [Turbine Discharge Pressure (TPR)](./Turbine%20Discharge%20Pressure%20(TPR).md), and [Torque](./Torque.md)
- comprehension of these instruments and indications enables the technician to identify the performance and airworthiness of the jet engine

### System Operation (Temperature)
- each [K-type Thermocouple](./K-type%20Thermocouple.md) (or any thermocouple) may have single or multiple hot junctions. When connected in a closed-loop, the conductors change resistance at a set rate when heated, affecting average current produced.
- when heated, free electrons move from hot to cold junctions then back. Thus, creating a current.
- Electron theory and hot-cold junction ends
	- electrons flow from hot to cold then hot due to the current pressure, creating a loop
	- if: heat is applied on both junctions
		- then: current is produced on both ends
		- effect: current is cancelled out = no current flow = no reading
- for Ram effect consideration (fluid motion), refer to [Turbine Engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) > Ram Effect Consideration](./Turbine%20Engine%20Exhaust%20Gas%20Temperature%20(EGT).md#Ram%20Effect%20Consideration)
