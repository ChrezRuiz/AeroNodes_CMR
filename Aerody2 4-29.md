Aircraft testing at lower load factor or low loading to pish aircraft to the limit without necessarily destroying it

lighter, the better load factor

power works well at low speed

# Lecture 7: Glide
Max Range is not glide range
- max range considers propulsion
- glide range doesn't consider propulsion due to lack of such

Wingless (lifting bodies) fly for re-entry, very high mach
- high altoitutde, thus high drag
- low AoA
- higher AoA only at re-entry and very low to the ground (for glide)

Glide is low-speed parameter
- related to endurance

L/D is a max parameter for low speed, vice-versa for high-speed

better glide at lesser glide angle for more horizontal component effect

headwing is better for glide range due to low speed (shallow glide)

faster speed makes descent rate faster
