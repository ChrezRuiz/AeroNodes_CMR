Propulsion Devices utilizing airfoil shaped blades to utilize aerodynamics as a means to produce a resultant force for [Thrust](./Thrust.md). 

### Thrust Generation
#### Principle 1 (Blade Angles)

[Thrust](./Thrust.md) is generated by spinning a blade with an airfoil shape. This creates a [Lift (L)](./Lift%20(L).md) and [Drag Polar](./Drag%20Polar.md) effect, which then produces a resultant force parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft or of the nose. 

*Due to the rotation*, the blade interacts with both True Air Speed (TAS) $(v)$ and the angular velocity $(w)$ which can be converted to linear velocity. 
*Thus*, forming a resultant velocity $(R)$, *which* forms an angled axis for the Angle of Attack $(\theta)$. Such that, the both TAS and $w$ affects the $\theta$ of a blade, *consequently*, affecting the [Efficiency](Efficiency.md) and [Thrust](./Thrust.md) of the propeller.

*Therefore,* modern propellers actively adjust the blade angle of attack $\beta$ to keep the $\theta$ at an optimal level during an increase in $v$ while maintaining constant $w$.

*Calculating blade angles,* is simply through [Trigonometric Functions](Trigonometric%20Functions.md), such that $\theta$ is often a given constant as it depends on the airfoil profile, unless the propeller blade is a constant pitch. 
#### Principle 2 (Pitch Types)
The distance at which a propeller blade travels is based on its $\theta$. Evident in **Principle 1**, a propeller's $\theta$ does is not based on the axis of the propeller, that would be the [Angle of Incidence](./Angle%20of%20Incidence.md) $(\alpha)$. 

Rather, an analysis of the pitch types generated can provide data on the distance travelled.
