Crucial in the [Aircraft Design](Aircraft%20Design.md) is the analysis of the performance it is capable to output. Such an analysis can be achieved through logic systems based on previous discussions on aerodynamic concepts.

In this case we can look into the Lift, Velocity, Drag, Profile shape, and many others that will be discussed in this chapter note.

# Thrust and Propellers
Thrust and is a major discussion for performance as velocity is related to all aspects of flight.

# Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem
Various Coefficients are tackled in this chapter. Obtaining each properly is required. A common Method is through the Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem which cancels out all basic units.
