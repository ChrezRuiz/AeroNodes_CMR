Crucial in the [Aircraft Design](Aircraft%20Design.md) is the analysis of the performance it is capable to output. Such an analysis can be achieved through logic systems based on previous discussions on aerodynamic concepts.

It is affected by both the [Aerodynamics](./Aerodynamics.md) and [Aircraft Powerplant](./Aircraft%20Powerplant.md) of an aircraft

In this case we can look into the Lift, Velocity, Drag, Profile shape, and many others that will be discussed in this chapter note.

# I. Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem
Various Coefficients are tackled in this chapter. Obtaining each properly is required. A common Method is through the Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem which cancels out all basic units.

# II. Thrust Basics
Thrust and is a major discussion for performance as velocity is related to all aspects of flight.

# IV. Drag Polar
Drag force affects the aerodynamics of an aircraft, thus affecting performance. Analysis of the variable is important for proper determination of aircraft performance.

# VI. Range & Endurance
Differentiating the range and endurance capabilities of an aircraft determines the mission scope of the design.
