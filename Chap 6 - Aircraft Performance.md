Crucial in the [Aircraft Design](Aircraft%20Design.md) is the analysis of the performance it is capable to output. Such an analysis can be achieved through logic systems based on previous discussions on aerodynamic concepts.

It is affected by both the [Aerodynamics](./Aerodynamics.md) and [Aircraft Powerplant](./Aircraft%20Powerplant.md) of an aircraft

In this case we can look into the Lift, Velocity, Drag, Profile shape, and many others that will be discussed in this chapter note.

# I. Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem
Various Coefficients are tackled in this chapter. Obtaining each properly is required. A common Method is through the Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem which cancels out all basic units.

# II. Thrust Basics
Thrust and is a major discussion for performance as velocity is related to all aspects of flight.

# The Tic-Tac-Toe
- The Tic-Tac-Toe is a term used to indicate table discussed during my Aerodynamics 2 instructor's lectures, that being Eng. Delicano. It is served as a good general guideline into understanding which $\frac{L}{D}$ condition to be used at a specific scenario
- Due to its simplicity and aid, it'll be included and referred to as such
- *Conditions are not always a substitution process, rather, most of which requires derivation. Be wary of how each equation to be discussed is derived and remember which can simply be substituted*
	- However, if a parameter is being asked for a specific mission requirement or maximizing or minimizing a different parameter, then the table may be used

# IV. Drag Polar
Drag force affects the aerodynamics of an aircraft, thus affecting performance. Analysis of the variable is important for proper determination of aircraft performance.
