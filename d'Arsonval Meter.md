- a sensing mechanism for DC ammeters
- cold junction in the circuit

### Calibration:
- a calibrating resistor is installed to set a total resistance required
	- typically 8, 15, 22 ohms 
- electric resistance setting is dependent on the distance of thermocouple and the cockpit indicator and the wire properties
	- *recall:* wire length, properties, and geometry effect to wire resistance
