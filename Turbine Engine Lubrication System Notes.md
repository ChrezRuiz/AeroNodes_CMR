## Engine Lubricating Oils
*Primary Purpose:* Friction Reduction
*Rationale:* Due to moving parts with contact, friction and heat occurs which causes damage

### Functions:
- Reduces Friction
	- Surfaces have rough surfaces at a microscopic level, *causing* wear and tear during contact
	- *Principle:* Sliding than grinding by filling peaks and valleys through Engine oil
	- *Friction types:*
		- Sliding Friction
		- Rolling Friction (Bearing)
		- Wiping Friction (Teeth of Gears)
- Heat Absorption
	- *Principle:* Engine oil acts as heat sink by heat absorption, then passing to oil coolers for fluid to air heat exchange
- Seals
	- *Principle:* For leak avoidance in moving parts
- Cushion
	- *Principle:* Provides cushioning effect etweren metals (radial, axial, thrust) by providing a soft barrier between metals
- Cleans
	- serves as cleaning agent by pickup up foreign particles (contaminants) to be filtered
- Protects Against Corrosion
	- coating engine parts to form a barrier prevents Oxygen and moisture from causing corrosion from contact reaction

### Consumption Rate:
*dependent on Engine speed, temperature, operating clearances, and lubricant characteristics*
- temperature causes oil breakdown, lower viscosity (reducing functionality)
- lower clearances prevent engine consumption, but may cause more friction; vice-versa
- lubricatn characterstic (viscosity): thinner causes faster rate of flow, thus higher consumption rate

### Oil Properties:
- Viscosity - measure of oil's resistance to flow
	- measured through Saybolt Universal Viscosimeter
	- recorded time of flow - Saybolt Universal Seconds Viscosity (SUS)
	- Lower viscosity for cold climates, high viscosity for warm climates
	- Prioritize low viscosity due to main function to lubricate bearings and gears
		- flows eaasily thus reducing friction
		- but viscous enough for sealing and other functions
- Viscosity Index - rate of change in viscosity for a given chnge in temperature
	- high index, small change per temp change
	- higher the better, thus able to resist change
- Specific Gravity - comparison of weight to the weight of an equal Water volume at specified temperature
	- American Petrleum Institute (API) formulated a measurement for the specific gravity of oils that is an expansion of the regular specific graibty scale
		- more accuracy
- Color
	- determined by amount of light passing through (opacity)
	- tested through ASTM Union Colorimeter
	- compared to an ASTM color chart
		- 1.00 = pure white
		- 8.00 = darker than claret red
	- 85% Kerosene, 15% Fuel
		- ratio for determination of contaminants
	- Bloom - refers to the color output during a color test with indirect or reflected light, determining the origin of the oil
- Cloud Point
	- rfers to the temp at which wax in oil starts to solidify and come out of solution
	- tem drop, causes wax components present in some ols (paraffin wax), forming crustals and separate from the liquid oil
	- causes clogging
- Pour Point
	- lowest temp at which oil will continue to flow (or change to semi-solid state)
	- refers to how the oil behaves at cold temperatures
- *Flash Point*
	- *lowest temp at which oil can form vapor that will ignite*
- *Fire Point*
	- *lowest temp at which the oil will continuously burn for a set specific time*
	- *once reached, it can sustain fire on its own*
- *Carbon Residue Test*
	- *diagnostic procedure performed on oils to assess their tendency to form deposits during use*
- *Ash test*
	- *oil purity*
	- *extension of carbon residue test*

- Oil Jets
	- fixed nozzles ensuring constant flow to main bearings across engine speeds
	- crucial for main rotor bearings due to high speed and load, vital for turbine bearings due to heat exposure
	- *located:* pressure lines adjacent to or within bearing compartments and rotor shaft couplings
	- deliver lubrication oil as solid oil spray or air oil mist
		- air oil mist - atomized
		- solid oil - includes solid lubricants (graphite, molibdenum solphite)
			- preferred for oil-dampened bearings,, reduces rotor vibrations and compensating for misalignments
	- *Importance of maintenance*:
		- ensures constant oil flow
		- prevents bearing failure
		-  nozzle is prne to clogging, accessible only during engine overhaul for cleaning
		- last chance filters upstream from oil jets to prevent nozzle clogs crucial to prevent bearing failure
- Vent System 
	- *aka:* Breather System
	- Venting Bearing Chambers and accerssory gearbox to oil reservoir
	- *Purpose:* 
		- Prevent excessive pressure buildup
		- Maintain proper pressure differential in bearing chambers
		- Ensure oil jets maintain correct spray pattern
		- Releases air pockets (bearing cavities) to ensure smooth flow
	- Pressurized air aids in:
		- Positive Oil Flow to Pump
		- Minimizing Foaming of Oil
- Check Valves
	- installed in oil supply line of dry-sump oil systems
	- prevent supply oil from seeping through oil pump elements and high pressure lines after shutdown
	- typically spring-loaded, ball-and-socket valves allowng free flow of pressurized oil in one direction
	- pressure for open check valve varies, typically 2-5 psi
	- *Importance:* 
		- prevents oil accumulation in accessory geabox, compressor rear housing, and combustion chamber

		- Prevents contamination of cabin pressurization air and internal oil fire
- Oil Cooler
	- cooler typically handles excess heat
	- either pressure subsystem or savenge subsystem
	- hot tank system (pressure subsystem) - oil enters reservoir without cooling
	- cold tank sysrem (scavenge subsystem) - oil is cooled immeaduately before entiering subsystem
		- for lubrication purposes, where excess oil is removed
		- primary function: remove excess oil and heat, thus low temp
- Oil Chip Detector
	- *Purpose:* 
		- determines if there is wear and tear in main bearings
		- prevents metal particles from circulating
		- provide valuable information for torubleshooting engine problems
	- Permanent Magnet Chip attract and retain ferrous metal particles
	- *Indication mechanism:*
		- small fuzzy particles or grey metalic paste: normal
