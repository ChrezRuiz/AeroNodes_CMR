Drag Coefficient << refers to the total drag coefficient due to other drag coefficients; generally the sum of [Parasitic Drag Coefficient (C_D0)](./Parasitic%20Drag%20Coefficient%20(C_D0).md) and [Induced Drag Coefficient (C_di)](./Induced%20Drag%20Coefficient%20(C_di).md)

equation ;; $$ C_d = C_{d0} + C_{di} $$
