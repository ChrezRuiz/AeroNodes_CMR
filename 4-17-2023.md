### Body

Open cycle Rocket
Ox Cycle (Closed cycle)
- Pre-burner must be higher pressure tan the main combustion section

Full-flow Staged combustion cycle
- Avoiding stochiometric effects due to pre-burner unsync
- Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator

Combustion Tap-off Cycle
- turbine harvests flow from combustion chamber through a tube or hole

Expander Cycle


Starting the ignition
NASA STANDARD DTONATOR
- for separation and ignition

For liquid
- Purging and Thermal Conditioning
	- Cryogenic propellant issues (liquid oxygen), such as brittle effects
	- Purging from moisture and air pockets (usually through nitrogen) such as helium 
	- Thermal conditioning through cryogenic propellant
	- Venting out of gas (boiled) cryogenic propellant through controlled  remote vents 
	- Propellant boiling causes cavitation
	- Stochiometric conditions is bad
	- Engine must be brought down to ambient temperatures (engine chilldown is crucial)
	- Hypergaulic propellants
- Spin-up of turbines
	- pre-burner or gas generator through ground systems or high pressure helium
	- bootstrapping or dead head starting  
- Transients
- Combustion
	- hard start, when combustion occurs during a reaction between oxidizer and fuel at an unintended area which causes stress and damage to the engine
	- spark plug through sparking one end to another
