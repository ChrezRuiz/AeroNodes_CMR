### Functions:
- Reduce [Friction](./Friction.md)
    - Surfaces have rough surfaces at a microscopic level, _causing_ wear and tear during contact
    - _Principle:_ Sliding than grinding by filling peaks and valleys through Engine oil prevents or reduces contact due to [Viscosity](./Viscosity.md) properties
    - ![Friction > Types Concerning Engine Lubrication](./Friction.md#Types%20Concerning%20Engine%20Lubrication)
- [Heat (Q)](./Heat%20(Q).md) Absorption
    - _Principle:_ Engine oil acts as a heat sink which is cooled through coolers to regulate heat exchange
- Seals
    - _Principle:_ Oil viscosity acts as a barrier between areas by filling microscopic gaps between components, preventing leaks
- Cushion
    - _Principle:_ Provides cushioning effect etweren metals (radial, axial, thrust) by providing a soft barrier between metals
- Cleans
    - serves as cleaning agent by pickup up foreign particles (contaminants) to be filtered
- Protects Against Corrosion
    - coating engine parts to form a barrier prevents Oxygen and moisture from causing corrosion from contact reaction
