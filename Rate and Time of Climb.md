- the speed or rate at which the aircraft gains altitude
	- or the vertical speed achieved during climb

### Equations:
*derived from the [4 Forces of Flight](4%20Forces%20of%20Flight.md); note that R/C changes based on height due to $\rho$ changes affecting $P_r$*  

- ##### General R/C Equation $$\text{R/C}=Vsin(\theta)$$
- ##### Equation using principle of Power $$R/C=\frac{\text{Excess Power}}{W}=\frac{P_{a}-P_{r}}{W}=\frac{V(T-D)}{W}$$
- ##### General Time to Climb Equation $$t_{climb}=\int_{h_{1}}^{h_{2}}\frac{dh}{R/C}$$
- ##### Time to climb equation given different $R/C$ and an $R/C_{max}$ $$t_{climb}=\frac{h_{abs}}{R/C_{max}}\left[ln\left(\frac{h_{abs}}{h_{abs}-h}\right)\right]$$
- ##### Time to climb equation given two different $R/C$ $$t_{climb}=\frac{1}{k}\left[ln\left(\frac{(R/C)_{h_{1}}}{(R/C)_{h_{2}}}\right)\right]$$ $$\text{where }k=\frac{d(R/C)}{dh}$$
