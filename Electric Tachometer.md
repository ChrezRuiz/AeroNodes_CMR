### Definition
- distance between the engine and the tachometer limits the use of flexible drive shaft
- tachometer generators are installed in both the engine and the cockpit, such that AC voltage is produced to transfer RPM data through frequency measurements

---
### For Turbojets
#### Types
- Based on Fan Speed and low speed compressor speed
	- *Principle:* installed at the shroud, the blades interrupt produced magnetic fields. Measuring the frequency of interruption can be used to calculate RPM. 
- Based on gear-driven shaft
	- *Principle:* a gear-driven shaft rotates a permanent magnet installed past a stationary pickup coil, such that, rotation induces voltage. Frequency can be used to calculate RPM.


#### Designations
