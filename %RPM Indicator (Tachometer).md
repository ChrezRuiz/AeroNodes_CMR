### Definition:
- *displayed in:* [Electric Tachometer](./Electric%20Tachometer.md) (%RPM)
- due to no section having similar speeds, the % of its max speed is used for simplicity
- *influenced by:* Fuel Flow measured through [Fuel Flow Indicator](./Fuel%20Flow%20Indicator.md)
- *for [Centrifugal Flow Compressor](Centrifugal%20Flow%20Compressor.md):* 
	- thrust is directly indicated
- *for [Axial Flow Compressor](Axial%20Flow%20Compressor.md):* 
	- RPM is displayed to monitor overspeed conditions

### Basic Functions:
- Monitor engine speed
- Monitor over-speeding
- Indicate section speed and thrust
- Check operating schedules of engine support systems
- Check engine speed during in-flight shutdown and windmilling

### Typical RPM Limits and Actions
*the following are general or common procedures conducted post-operation involving reaching set RPM limits*

| ==%RPM Limit==          | ==Action Required==                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 104% < RPM < 106.2% | Special Inspection (Borescope Inspection) |
| RPM > 106.2%        | Engine Overhaul                           |
