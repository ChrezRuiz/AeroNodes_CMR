### Definition
- *measures:* [Turbine Engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)](./Turbine%20Engine%20Exhaust%20Gas%20Temperature%20(EGT).md) 
- *installed in:* multiple thermocouples around the circumference of the [GTE Exhaust Section](./GTE%20Exhaust%20Section.md) casing
- difference between each system is dependent on the location of each sensing gauge
- indicates average temperature measured by thermocouples
