Markings provide the pilot or engineer with easy to decipher data and a general overview of the condition range that the current engine's condition is in.

# Fuel Pressure
- when @ Red arc : Max or Min Permissible Pressure for the engine operating limits
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation
- when @ Amber : Caution; Potential Hazard consult other instruments (Icing, Malfunction, leak, etc)

# Oil Pressure
- when @ Red arc : Max or Min Permissible Pressure for the engine operating limits
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation
- when @ Amber : Caution for overpressure, low-pressure during idle, etc

# Oil Temperature
- when @ Red arc : Max or Min Permissible Temperatures for the engine operating limits
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation
- when @ Amber : Caution; Potential Hazard due to overheating or low temperature

# [Torque Indicating System (Torquemeter)](./Torque%20Indicating%20System%20(Torquemeter).md)
- when @ Red arc : Max permissible torque pressure for dry or wet operation, whichever is greater
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation (Min to Max operation for prolonged use)
- when @ Amber : Caution; Potential Hazard due to the use or prolonged use of maximum permissible torque pressure

# [Exhaust Gas Temperature Gauge](./Exhaust%20Gas%20Temperature%20Gauge.md)
- when @ Red arc : Max permissible EGT for dry or wet operation, whichever is greater
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation (Min to Max operation for prolonged use)
- when @ Amber : Caution; Potential Hazard due to the use or prolonged use of maximum permissible EGT limits

# [%RPM Indicator (Tachometer)](./%25RPM%20Indicator%20(Tachometer).md) 
*Tachometer*
- when @ Red arc : Max permissible RPM speed or %
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation (Min to Max operation for prolonged use)
- when @ Amber : Caution; Potential Hazard due to the use or prolonged use of maximum permissible RPM speed or %

# Dual [%RPM Indicator (Tachometer)](./%25RPM%20Indicator%20(Tachometer).md) 
- when @ Red arc : Max permissible RPM speed or %
- when @ Green arc : Normal Operation (Min to Max operation for prolonged use)
- when @ Amber : Caution; Potential Hazard due to the use or prolonged use of maximum permissible RPM speed or %
