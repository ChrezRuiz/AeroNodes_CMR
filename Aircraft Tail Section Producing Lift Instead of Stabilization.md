[Aircraft](./Aircraft.md) designs are traditionally concepted to have an [Aircraft Tail Section](./Aircraft%20Tail%20Section.md) that's main goal is to provide [Stability](./Stability.md) in both horizontal and vertical axis. 

However, [Bird tails](./Bird%20tails.md) do not have vertical stabilizers, instead, adjust their tail section actively to provide directional stability while producing [Lift (L)](quartz/content/Aero%20Academe%20&%20R&D%20Nodes/Engineering%20Concepts%20&%20Subjects/Aerodynamics/Lift%20(L).md) to compensate for their [Weight (W)](./Weight%20(W).md) more efficiently even at low air [Velocity](./Velocity.md) to achieve efficient [Glide](./Glide.md).
