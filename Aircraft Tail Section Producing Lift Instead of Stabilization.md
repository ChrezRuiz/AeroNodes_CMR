[[./Aircraft|Aircraft]] designs are traditionally concepted to have an [[./Aircraft Tail Section|Aircraft Tail Section]] that's main goal is to provide [[./Stability|Stability]] in both horizontal and vertical axis. 

However, [[./Bird tails|Bird tails]] do not have vertical stabilizers, instead, adjust their tail section actively to provide directional stability while producing [[quartz/content/Aero Academe & R&D Nodes/Engineering Concepts & Subjects/Aerodynamics/Lift (L)|Lift (L)]] to compensate for their [[./Weight (W)|Weight (W)]] more efficiently even at low air [[./Velocity|Velocity]] to achieve efficient [[./Glide|Glide]].
