### Ram Effect Consideration
*adequate consideration to fluid motion effects to parameters is required for accurate indication*
*Recall:* $\frac{T_{t}}{T_{s}}$ ratio with $M$ 
$$\frac{T_{t}}{T_{s}}=1+\left[\frac{\gamma -1}{2}(M^{2})\right]$$
Such that, temperature rise due to ram effects can be calculated, and the actual temperature can also be determined. Depending on the [K-type Thermocouple](./K-type%20Thermocouple.md), it can identify either.

### EGT Limits
- Internal Temperature Affects Engine lifetime
- Modern engines are designed to start and maintain at lowest possible temperatures
	- immediate start of high temperatures reduces service life
	- low starting temperature allows cooling air to pass
