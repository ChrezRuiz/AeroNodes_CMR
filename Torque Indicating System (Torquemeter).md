- propeller and shaft-based engines produce torque, a determinant of engine force output
- commonly measures torque oil pressure 

### Torque and Power
Power can be measured through the amount of torque input, however, for cockpit use, it is often an indication of the performance of the engine and monitor torque limits
*Recall:* ![Power > Power and Torque](./Power.md#Power%20and%20Torque)

### System Types
Each system relies on the angular distortion caused by the torsion applied on each shaft. This angle is taken advantage of through different systems to measure and indicate the torque produced.
*Recall:* ![Torsion > General Equation](./Torsion.md#General%20Equation)
- ![Electronic Torque Indicating System](./Electronic%20Torque%20Indicating%20System.md)
- ![Balanced Oil Piston Hydromechanical Torque Indicating System](./Balanced%20Oil%20Piston%20Hydromechanical%20Torque%20Indicating%20System.md)

### Torque Limits
Torque limits are based on time. Such that, each engine and manufacturers have their own guidelines into operations necessary after reaching a set torque.
