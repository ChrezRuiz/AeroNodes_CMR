Lift (L) << refers to the force caused by [Dynamic Pressure (q)](./Dynamic%20Pressure%20(q).md) of the local air, the aircraft characteristics based on the [Wing Area (s)](./Wing%20Area%20(s).md), and the [Lift Coefficient (C_l)](Lift%20Coefficient%20(C_l).md) of the wing; equal to the [Weight (W)](./Weight%20(W).md) at steady level unaccelerated flight

equation;; $$L = qsC_l = W \text{ @ steady level unaccelerated flight}$$ ^d0079e
