Lift (L) << refers to the force caused by [[./Dynamic Pressure (q)|Dynamic Pressure (q)]] of the local air, the aircraft characteristics based on the [[./Wing Area (s)|Wing Area (s)]], and the [[Lift Coefficient (C_l)|Lift Coefficient (C_l)]] of the wing; equal to the [[./Weight (W)|Weight (W)]] at steady level unaccelerated flight

equation;; $$L = qsC_l = W \text{ @ steady level unaccelerated flight}$$
