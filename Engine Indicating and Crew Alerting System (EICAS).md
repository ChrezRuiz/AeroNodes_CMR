### Crew Alerting System
#### Colors:
- **Gray Region** - normal condition
- **Red Region** - exceeded limit
- **Amber point** - High/Low Caution
- **Red point** - Maximum/ Minimum limit
- **Red Frame** - when exceeded limit, does not revert
*for more:* [EICAS](https://www.aeroclass.org/eicas/)

#### Indications on the EICAS:
##### I. Left of Display:
- A/T LIM
	- illuminates when auto-throttle limit is active
- CRZ 
	- illuminates when thrust mode for the engines is cruise
- TAT - 12c 
	- illuminates when total air temperature is 12 degrees C
- REV
	- illuminates when left engine is in reverse thrust 
- 96.0 
	- N<sub>1</sub> take-off speed is at 96% fan speed
- N<sub>1</sub> 
	- indicates LPC speed on both engines
- TAI 
	- illuminates when anti-ice was on
- X-BLD START 
	- illuminates when cross-bleed engine start is ongoing
- N<sub>2</sub> 
	- indicates HPC on both engines
- FF/FU
	- indicates fuel flow in both engines
- FUEL LB
	- indicates fuel level in three separate tanks in terms of lb
##### II. Right of Display
- OIL P
	- oil pressure indication
- OIL T
	- oil temperature indication
- OIL Q%
	- oil tank level indication
- VIB
	- vibration level indication
