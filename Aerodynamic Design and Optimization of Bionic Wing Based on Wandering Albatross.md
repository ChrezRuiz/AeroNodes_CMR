# Key Take-aways
## Albatross As A Basis
An [[Albatross|Albatross]] is among the birds with the most efficient [[./Glide|Glide]], such that their [[./Wing|Wing]] structure is the most ideal for analysis when designing gliders. The study aims to analyze the bird's wing geometry, then optimized through [[Genetic Algorithm|Genetic Algorithm]] paired with [[Vortex Lattice Method|Vortex Lattice Method]] for aerodynamic calculations. The [[Wing Span|Wing Span]], [[Dihedral Angle|Dihedral Angle]], and [[Sweep Angle|Sweep Angle]] are considered factors of optimization. 
## Wing Analysis
The wing is divided into three sections from the body (not center axis) to the wing tip where the wing tip. A set parameters of measurements for the [[Chord Length|Chord Length]] and aforementioned wing parameters is also provided after analysis. The airfoil section for the optimization is also identified based on a series of GOE Albatross airfoil shapes and a [[./Reynolds Number|Reynolds Number]] range between 250000 to 300000. Through which, the [[GOE 174|GOE 174]] is identified to be the best for the study due to low pitching moment and high lift-to-drag ratio at large attack ranges.
