# Key Take-aways
## Albatross As A Basis
An [Albatross](Albatross.md) is among the birds with the most efficient [Glide](./Glide.md), such that their [Wing](./Wing.md) structure is the most ideal for analysis when designing gliders. The study aims to analyze the bird's wing geometry, then optimized through [Genetic Algorithm](Genetic%20Algorithm.md) paired with [Vortex Lattice Method](Vortex%20Lattice%20Method.md) for aerodynamic calculations. The [Wing Span](Wing%20Span.md), [Dihedral Angle](Dihedral%20Angle.md), and [Sweep Angle](Sweep%20Angle.md) are considered factors of optimization. 
## Wing Analysis
The wing is divided into three sections from the body (not center axis) to the wing tip where the wing tip. A set parameters of measurements for the [Chord Length](Chord%20Length.md) and aforementioned wing parameters is also provided after analysis. The airfoil section for the optimization is also identified based on a series of GOE Albatross airfoil shapes and a [Reynolds Number](./Reynolds%20Number.md) range between 250000 to 300000. Through which, the [GOE 174](GOE%20174.md) is identified to be the best for the study due to low pitching moment and high lift-to-drag ratio at large attack ranges.
