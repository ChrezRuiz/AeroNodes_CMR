- most modern; takes into consideration fuel temperature, specific gravity with an accuracy of $\pm$ 1 percent while displaying digitally

### System Components
- Spring
- Drum
- Impeller
- Magnet A and B

### System Operation
- Fuel enters from the drive-end, imparting rotational motion into magnet A and the drive shaft
- Drive shaft, connected to Impeller of Magnet B through a spring, rotates Magnet B 
- Magnets produce electronic impulses into stationary coils which can be measured to calculate fuel flow
- Magnet B produces current pulse lagged from Magnet A due to spring connection, where lag time or phase angle $\propto \dot{m}$
