Phase Shift System
Shaft Twist measurement

### System Components
- Cockpit Indicator
- Torque Signal
- Transmitter
- Inner and Outer Drive Shaft

### System Operation
- A reference shaft interacts with a reference coil
- A torque shaft interacts with a torque coil which is delayed compared to the reference shaft due to load applied from the output shaft and reduction gearbox
- Measuring the phase angle or the distance between each frequency, the angle of distortion can be measured and used to calculate torque
