### Definition
- *Principle:* thrust produced for turbofan engines can be calculated through pressure data at the **engine inlet** and **high-pressure turbine discharge** (nozzle)
- *Recall:* ![Thrust > Engine Thrust Equation](./Thrust.md#Engine%20Thrust%20Equation) ![Bernoulli's Equation > General Equation](./Bernoulli's%20Equation.md#General%20Equation)![Bernoulli's Equation > Basic Continuity Equation](./Bernoulli's%20Equation.md#Basic%20Continuity%20Equation)
- *Thus:* Pressure data acquisition at both the inlet and outlet can be used to calculate the velocity at both regions and to calculate both factors of the thrust equation
- *location:* 

### Modern Systems
- Differential pressure transducer analyzes pressure at each probe to indicate data in the cockpit
- Modern systems compensate for airspeed and altitude effects *(Recall [Density](./Density.md))*
