## Key Take-aways
The [[./Aircraft Tail Section|Aircraft Tail Section]] provides passive pitch stability which produces low or [[./Negative Lift|Negative Lift]]. However, if the stabilizers act on the same plane, it may compensate for lost [[quartz/content/Aero Academe & R&D Nodes/Engineering Concepts & Subjects/Aerodynamics/Lift (L)|Lift (L)]] over the [[./Fuselage|Fuselage]]. The latter is not applied due to required active controls. 
Hawks, which are able to have active control of lift surfaces, are tested and observed to produce downwash velocity behind its centerline, consequently producing constant [[quartz/content/Aero Academe & R&D Nodes/Engineering Concepts & Subjects/Aerodynamics/Lift (L)|Lift (L)]] per [[./Planform Area|Planform Area]], a requirement to reduce [[./Viscous Drag|Viscous Drag]] and [[./Profile Drag|Profile Drag]] for low [[./Reynolds Number|Reynolds Number]] flights. Therefore, birds are capable of producing sufficient lift at low air [[./Velocity|Velocity]], allowing slow glides and stall prevention without the need for morphed wings.
