- *temperature @ the:* [Turbine Section (Jet Engine)](./Turbine%20Section%20(Jet%20Engine).md) Outlet
- measured through thermocouples installed at the turbine outlet
- for practicality, it is assumed to be equal to [Turbine Engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)](./Turbine%20Engine%20Exhaust%20Gas%20Temperature%20(EGT).md)
	- though EGT is lower, the data is sufficient for an analysis of aircraft performance
