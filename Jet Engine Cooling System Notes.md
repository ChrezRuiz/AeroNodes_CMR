## Engine Cooling System
- considerably hot inside a GTE
- [Heat (Q)](./Heat%20(Q).md) is necessary to create work
- GTE provide ideal fule ratio of 15:1
		- in practice, large amount of air over the ideal ratio is provided, where the excess serves as coolant

## Nacelles and Compressor Cooling
- [Ram Air](Ram%20Air.md) caused by the natural flow of air around and through tthe components (Main cooling for cold sections)
		- Ram Air Intake - aorcraft's forward motion forces air into the engine's intake, where it is compressed by the compressor
	- Nacelle Cooling
			- Nacelle houses the engine, cooled by the airflow around it
		- Air Bleed
				- extracted from bleed air (additional cooling)

## Engine Compartment

## Cooling Stages
- During Flight
		- via ram air for both engine compartments
	- Ground Cooling
			- airflow is provided by reduced pressure at the rear of the nacelle, casing airflow through the nacelle

## Accessory Section

![Pasted image 20240502133509.png](./Fleeting%20Notes/Pasted%20image%2020240502133509.png)
- 1 to maintain temp
- 2 to prevent buildu of harmful vapor, thus pressure vanes

![Pasted image 20240502133640.png](./Fleeting%20Notes/Pasted%20image%2020240502133640.png)
- Zone 1 - pressure relief door
- Zone 3 - back-end

**Main Purpose:** maintain reliability and efficiency

### Cooling Types
![Pasted image 20240502134001.png](./Fleeting%20Notes/Pasted%20image%2020240502134001.png)
- Thermal Insulation - for sensitive components (FCU)
- Ram Air Cooling - accessory section receives cooling from the natural flow of ram air as the aircraft moves forward
- Oil Cooling - reliant on oil lubrication and cooling
- Internal Air Flow - utilize internal ducting to direct a portion of compressor discharge air (bleed air) to the accessory section for cooling
- Heat Exchangers - transfer heat from the accessory section to other areas of the engine or the aircraft where it can be dissipated more effectively (transfer heat from accessory to other areas)

## Combustion Section
- intense heat is generated when fuel and air are burned, thus needs cooling

### Perforation
- smaller - effective cooling
- larger - ensures efficiency of flame propagation of air flow
- 2ndary air in the engine (75%) is used or cooling 
		- secondary air forms a cooling blanket
		- centers combustion flames to prevent contact
		- mixed with burned gases and cools the air to provide an even distribution of energy to the turbine nozzle at a temp that the turbine seciton can withstand

## Turbine Section Cooling
Why cool the turbine? 
- turbine section temp is primary limiting factor in GTW ops
- turbine cooling promotes enhancing of engine efficiency
- higher temp, more thrust
- prevent structural damage

Trailing Edge is critical due to minimal material that can conduct the heat
![Pasted image 20240502135812.png](./Fleeting%20Notes/Pasted%20image%2020240502135812.png)
- hollow spaces provide cooling

### Types
- Convection
		- internal cooling utilizing bleed air
		- turbulence is important (mixing)
- Impingement (means intrusion into an area)
		- internal cooling 
		- focus on leading edhe
		- impingement of air to trailing edge (move heat into the trailing edge)
- ![Pasted image 20240502140042.png](./Fleeting%20Notes/Pasted%20image%2020240502140042.png)
- Film
		- external cooling for turbine blades
		- post internal cooling
		- air is forced to flow on the surface
		- ![Pasted image 20240502140422.png](./Fleeting%20Notes/Pasted%20image%2020240502140422.png)
		- Thermal barrier coating (TBC) - ceramic coating which gives it higher emp resistance
- Transpiration
		- mostly for turbine nozzle vanes (stators)
		- use of porous material for cooling

## Engine Insulation
- temperature regulation
- heat protection
		- engine protection, prevent damage
- increases engine durability

### Insulation Blanket
- common materials
		- Al foil
			- very light material (very thin)
			- heat resistant 
			- low emissivity (little radiation effect)
		- Fiberglass
			- lightweight material of numerous fibers of glass
			- resists heat degradation (change of chemical composition due to heat)
			- non-combustible, but may release harmful chemicals
		- Ceramic Fiber
			- low thermal conductivity (prevents heat transfer)
			- resistant to thermal shock (rapid change in temp, which causes cracks)
			- prone to mechanical damage (brittle)
		- Aramid Fiber
			- aramid (10 microns)
			- kevlar material formed into threads
			- low thermal cnductivity
			- flame resistant; chars only
			- flexibility and formability (due to flexible tread material)
			- high strength
