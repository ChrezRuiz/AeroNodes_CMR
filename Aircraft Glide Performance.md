An Aircraft's glide performance is dependent on the aerodynamics of the aircraft. Such that, the lesser glide angle, the farther range. However, the effects of [Tailwind](Tailwind.md) and [Headwind](Headwind.md) on Glide Range is inverse of its effects to Range.

## Glide Angle Equation
$$tan(\theta)=\left(\frac{L}{D}\right)^{-1}$$
where:
- $\theta=\text{Glide Angle}$
