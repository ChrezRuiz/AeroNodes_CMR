*aka:* Fuel Flow Gauge
### Definition
- mass flow measurement of fuel for thrust and engine speed control
- receives a signal from a fuel flow transmitter
- *Note:* mass flow is measured instead of volume due to temperature effects

### Operation
- **Impeller** driven by constant speed through a three-phase electrical motor
- Fuel is guided to a turbine which is deflected by the angular motion of the fuel, thus rotating until the force produced by a calibrated restraining spring balance is equal to the rotational force
- The rotation affects a permanent magnet's position in both the indicator and the receiver
- Permanent magnet position affects needle indication position

### Fuel Totalizer
- some computerized fuel systems indicate other parameters including:
	- Fuel amount used
	- Fuel amount remaining
	- Current rate of fuel consumption
	- Time remaining based on current power setting
