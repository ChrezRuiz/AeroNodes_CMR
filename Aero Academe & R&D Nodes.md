## Introduction üëã
Welcome to the Aero Academe & R&D nodes project! Located in this vault are notes on <span style="background:rgba(5, 117, 197, 0.2)">Aero-Related (Aerospace & Aeronautical)</span> Concepts and Research Ideas. This serves as either a **General or Ultimate reference** and guide for all things aero. 

## Main Waypoints üó∫Ô∏è
*To begin, select from the following major waypoints. More to be added soon.*
- [[./Engineering Concepts & Subjects|Engineering Concepts & Subjects]]
- [[./Research Concepts and Ideas|Research Concepts and Ideas]]

## Vision of the Project üí≠
Provide a vault of notes that discusses most, if not all, Aero-related engineering concepts and connects them together, while providing research concepts and ideas that reference these concepts.

## Significance of the Project ü§î
Aero Engineering covers an expansive field of concepts and mathematics that continuously develop. These concepts are explained in detail in common references used by universities, but often are walls of text, and may have a difficulty illustrating the systems and connections between each topic, keyword, and concept. 
This project aims to be the the <span style="background:rgba(5, 117, 197, 0.2)">go-to reference</span> that illustrates connections between each topic for better understanding and critical thinking through relations and systems between each discussion through the use of canvas and graphs. <span style="background:rgba(5, 117, 197, 0.2)">Though this can be the main or only reference used, it is recommended that this be used as a supplementary reference.</span> Reading the main references provided can help gain a more comprehensive understanding, this project then aims to aid in connecting these ideas.

## Graphs and Canvas üß†
### Graphs
Graphs can be utilized to understand immediate connections between a topic. Such as the components of a Lift equation being connected with Wing Area (s), Dynamic Pressure (q), the Lift Coefficient ($C_l$), and Weight (W). Though these may be explained in text, a visualization aids in understanding more complex relations. Such that, other concepts or even literature references that call out the concept of Lift (L) can be observed. <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">It is recommended to use this feature for local or specific concept learning.</span>
An interpretation of such can be:
	*"I would like to optimize the lift of an aircraft, according to the graph, I would need to deal with either the wind area, the weight, and the lift coefficient of the machine... Which may improve the thrust and aerodynamics. Reference 1 may be worth reading, it relates something to lift, a design concept maybe? üòï"*

### Canvas
A canvas is utilized to better discuss large interconnected concepts in one view that may be overwhelming for graph uses. A good example of which is the canvas created for Aircraft Performance, where it discusses all the topics of the Aerodynamics chapter, in a way that relates together, which it does for better understanding of the topic and easier recall of concepts and equations. It may also be used to demonstrate problem solving and equation derivation without the for multiple note pages that often needs to be recalled. <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">It is recommended that the canvas be used for broad reviews, concept discussion, and problem solving.</span>
