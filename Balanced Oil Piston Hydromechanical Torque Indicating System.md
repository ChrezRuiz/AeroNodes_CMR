*Principle:* Shaft Twist measurement

### System Components
- Cockpit Gauge
- Electrical Transmitter
- Hydromechanical Sensor Mechanism
- Main Shaft Drive Gears
- Torsion Shaft

### System Operation
- Based on [Torsion](./Torsion.md) of the shaft, the torque can be calculated through the angle of deformation created from the torsion shaft due to the load produced from the output shaft and reduction gearbox
- Mechanical Systems measure the angle of deformity through a helix gear that pushes the pilot valve, affecting oil pressure passing through an pressure sensor, indicating torque.
