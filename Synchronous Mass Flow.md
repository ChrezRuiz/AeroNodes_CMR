- measured fuel [Mass Flow](Mass%20Flow.md) 
		- Mass flow measurements provide greater accuracy by compensating for temperature and density effects on volume

### System Components
- Cockpit Indicator
- Impeller
- Turbine
- Calibrated Restraining Springs

### System Operation
- Fuel enters transmitter impeller, rotated by a synchronous impeller motor at a set angular speed affected by the temperature of the fuel 
- Mass flow hits the turbine which is restrained by restraining springs
- Effect of turbine on restraining springs provide indication of fuel mass flow
